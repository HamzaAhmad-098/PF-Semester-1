## 🧠 Learning Outcome

> This repository marks the **beginning of my programming journey**. It showcases my understanding of basic programming concepts and my ability to build procedural logic in C++ for small problems and simulations.

## 📌 Notes

- This work reflects my growth from **zero programming knowledge to a confident C++ beginner**.
- In future semesters, I aim to improve these programs using **OOP, STL, and modern C++ techniques**.
- I plan to refactor some mini projects into **modular or object-oriented** versions.
