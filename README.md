# 💻 Programming Fundamentals (1st Semester)

This repository contains all the programming exercises, assignments, and projects I completed during my **first semester** of the Computer Science degree at UET Lahore.

## 📚 Course Overview

**Course Name:** Programming Fundamentals  
**Language Used:** C++  
**Topics Covered:**
- Input/Output and Data Types
- Operators and Expressions
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (For, While, Do-While)
- Functions
- Arrays (1D, 2D)
- Pointers (Basic)
- File Handling
- Simple C++ Projects

## 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ Completed foundational programming concepts in C++
- 📁 Structured code into Programming Labs and programming Days
- 🛠️ Developed mini projects like Console based applications and games (Metro train management / path finder's duel)
- 📚 Strengthened logic-building and problem-solving skills through hands-on coding

## 🔧 Tools & Environment

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Notepad(primary) / Dev C++ / Code::Blocks / VS Code
- **Compiler:** g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Platform:** Windows / Ubuntu Linux


## 🧠 Learning Outcome

> This repository marks the **beginning of my programming journey**. It showcases my understanding of basic programming concepts and my ability to build procedural logic in C++ for small problems and simulations.

## 📌 Notes

- This work reflects my growth from **zero programming knowledge to a confident C++ beginner**.
- In future semesters, I aim to improve these programs using **OOP, STL, and modern C++ techniques**.
- I plan to refactor some mini projects into **modular or object-oriented** versions.
